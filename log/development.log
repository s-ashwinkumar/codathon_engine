After roaming in the Pokeworld for days, he has finally managed to catch k such Pokemons.\r\n\r\nThe way he can make a Pokemon go through evolution is NOT by making them fight battles, but by using an evolution stone. Since he has k Pokemons, he naturally needs k evolution stones for every one of them, as well.\r\n\r\nNow it takes little Arihant one complete day, to use the evolution stone on one Pokemon. And for each Pokemon, he knows how many days will they take to evolute after the evolution stone has been used on them.\r\n\r\nHe will go to meet Professor Oak, the very next day, once all his Pokemons have gone through evolution.
